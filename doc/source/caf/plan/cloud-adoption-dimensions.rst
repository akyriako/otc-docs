Cloud Adoption Dimensions
==========================

As governments and enterprises have different strategic priorities and
development phases, the core motivations for them to go to the cloud may
differ. These core motivations should be determined based on actual
conditions. It is a good practice to focus on the following three
dimensions:

IT transformation
*****************

Currently, IT systems are facing the following challenges:

-  Low IT resource utilization, high costs, and complex maintenance and
   lifecycle management. Service units and departments use different
   data centers deployed with various types of servers and storage
   devices, and applications are bound to servers.

-  Insufficient capabilities of disaster recovery, security,
   scalability, and maintainability affect service stability and
   ability to expand on demand.

-  They are too slow to introduce new technologies, such as containers,
   cloud-native, and blockchain. Current IT systems are limited by
   insufficient capabilities and by their organization members' lack
   of experience. They urgently require new capabilities based on
   mature products and extensive experience on the cloud, so they can
   modernize and upgrade their IT systems, reduce costs and enhance
   efficiency, and build IT support capabilities for future industry
   competition.

-  IT organization transformation.
   Currently, IT departments are often positioned in support positions,
   passively supporting business development. However, as the digital
   transformation of the governments and enterprises deepens, IT and
   digital capabilities have become parts of planning, R&D, production,
   sales, service and operation, directly affecting business results and
   competitiveness. IT departments urgently need to change their roles.
   They need to be integrated into the production chain. IT departments and
   awareness, a culture, focused on a service-oriented cloud platform and
   on transforming their digital capabilities.

Data intelligence and data security
**********************************

Data has become a new production factor together with traditional
factors such as land, labor, capital, and technology.

-  In the government sector, data-driven government services and
   government governance collaboration across departments help with
   government administration, policy formulation, and decision-making.
   Data intelligence provides insights and responds quickly to social
   and economic trends, enhancing public satisfaction and government
   efficiency.

-  In the financial sector, data intelligence assists in customer
   marketing, risk control, and product design. It supports the
   expansion of key services such as supply chain finance and digital
   currency.

-  In the enterprise domain, data intelligence enables design and
   testing simulation, intelligent raw materials allocation, intelligent
   production scheduling, supply chain risk management, and operational
   visibility. It fully enhances efficiency and reduces risk.

Over time, data platforms have had to provide increasingly more robust
capabilities. The huge volumes of diverse types of data, the levels of
access concurrency, the constantly evolving data technologies and new
application scenarios demand high performance, efficiency, and
reliability. They demand platforms that can flexibly expand and rapidly
evolve. The requirements make a cloud service model the obvious choice.
Cloud service providers provide platforms with these technical
capabilities. The industry has become focused on scenario-specific
capabilities related to its own data.

Data security is increasingly related to security of both enterprises
and governments. Cloud service models facilitate of advanced security
technologies to centrally manage data security and provide maximum
security assurance.

Service and business innovations
********************************

Digitalization drives service innovation. It has been driving advances
in smart production, services, and operations, as well as innovations
like the sharing economy and industry chain collaboration, and there is
capability spillover. Technologies are needed for innovations:

-  New technological capabilities such as AI, IoT and blockchain.

-  Rapid rollout and iteration are required for first-mover
   opportunities. Cloud service models provide IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS
   capabilities that are always industry leading, lowering barriers to
   entry for service innovation, reducing costs, and accelerating
   innovation.
