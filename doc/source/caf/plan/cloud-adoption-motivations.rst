Cloud Adoption Motivations
==========================

Cloud Adoption Reasons
----------------------

The main reasons for cloud adoption are as follows:

Addressing problems related to software and hardware lifecycles
***************************************************************

When data centers and servers reach the end of their lifecycles, or when
multiple data centers are integrated, instead of using traditional data
centers, this can be a good time to start using advanced cloud service
models. A cloud service model can also help governments and enterprises
eliminate the complex lifecycle management involved with the physical IT
hardware, middleware, and technology platforms used in a traditional
model.

Enhancing service agility
*************************

Cloud services enhance service agility in the following ways:

-  Infrastructure resources are obtained as required for timely launch
   of new services. With physical hardware, you may have to wait weeks
   or even months for new equipment to arrive.

-  Applications and resources can be added on demand to rapidly scale
   services up or out as needed.

-  Technical platform services such as middleware, cloud-native, and
   DevOps can be obtained on demand to accelerate service rollout and
   help customers gain first-mover advantages.

Reducing IT costs
*****************

A cloud service model can adjust the amount of resources deployed based
on service requirements. This flexibility eliminates unnecessary
expenditures. It also lowers the capability requirements for O&M
personnel for the infrastructure and related technical platforms, which
reduces the cost of O&M. In a public cloud model, local data centers do
not need to be managed or maintained, and cloud resources and cloud
service capabilities can be obtained as required, greatly reducing IT
costs. In addition, the trial-and-error costs of trying out a new
service can be significantly reduced.

Enhancing O&M efficiency
***********************

Experienced O&M teams with hundreds or thousands of people from cloud
service vendors provide professional services, significantly enhancing
O&M quality and efficiency.

Improving reliability and security compliance
*********************************************

Cloud service models provide highly reliable, secure technical
capabilities fully compliant with industry regulations, based on a
robust library of best practices. It also provides assistance with
policy formulation, organization process development, and standard
certification.

Supporting global deployment
****************************

The global resources, networks, and platforms deployed on the cloud help
enterprises quickly launch new multinational services and collaborate
with headquarters in terms of services, data, and management.

Building data foundation and data assets
****************************************

The cloud service model helps governments and enterprises build data
foundations and data assets by using:

-  Advanced technologies such as big data, AI, data governance, and data
   security

-  Numerous industry best practices, including data platforms,
   performance optimization, data governance, organization process for
   data operation, and data intelligence application

-  Continuously introducing new technologies to accelerate innovations

Cloud service models ensure the industry-leading technologies and best
practices are always available to accelerate service and business
innovation. For example, cloud-native enables more agile services. AI
enables more intelligent decision-making and unmanned or less-manned
production. IoT provides connectivity of everything and intelligent
sensing, and blockchain enables trusted smart contracts.

Cloud Adoption Dimensions
-------------------------

As governments and enterprises have different strategic priorities and
development phases, the core motivations for them to go to the cloud may
differ. These core motivations should be determined based on actual
conditions. It is a good practice to focus on the following three
dimensions:

IT transformation
*****************

Currently, IT systems are faced with three difficulties:

-  Low IT resource utilization, high costs, and complex maintenance and
   lifecycle management. Service units and departments use different
   data centers deployed with various types of servers and storage
   devices, and applications are bound to servers.

-  Insufficient capabilities of disaster recovery, security,
   scalability, and maintainability affect service stability and
   ability to expand on demand.

-  They are too slow to introduce new technologies, such as containers,
   cloud-native, and blockchain. Current IT systems are limited by
   insufficient capabilities and by their organization members' lack
   of experience. They urgently require new capabilities based on
   mature products and extensive experience on the cloud, so they can
   modernize and upgrade their IT systems, reduce costs and enhance
   efficiency, and build IT support capabilities for future industry
   competition.

-  IT organization transformation.
   Currently, IT departments are often positioned in support positions,
   passively supporting business development. However, as the digital
   transformation of the governments and enterprises deepens, IT and
   digital capabilities have become parts of planning, R&D, production,
   sales, service, and operation, directly affecting business results and
   competitiveness. IT departments urgently need to change their roles.
   They need to be integrated into the production chain. IT departments and
   awareness, a culture, focused on a service-oriented cloud platform and
   on transforming their digital capabilities.

Data intelligence and data security
**********************************

Data has become a new production factor together with traditional
factors such as land, labor, capital, and technology.

-  In the government sector, data-driven government services and
   government governance collaboration across departments help with
   government administration, policy formulation, and decision-making.
   Data intelligence provides insights and responds quickly to social
   and economic trends, enhancing public satisfaction and government
   efficiency.

-  In the financial sector, data intelligence assists in customer
   marketing, risk control, and product design. It supports the
   expansion of key services such as supply chain finance and digital
   currency.

-  In the enterprise domain, data intelligence enables design and
   testing simulation, intelligent raw materials allocation, intelligent
   production scheduling, supply chain risk management, and operational
   visibility. It fully enhances efficiency and reduces risk.

Over time, data platforms have had to provide increasingly more robust
capabilities. The huge volumes of diverse types of data, the levels of
access concurrency, the constantly evolving data technologies and new
application scenarios demand high performance, efficiency, and
reliability. They demand platforms that can flexibly expand and rapidly
evolve. The requirements make a cloud service model the obvious choice.
Cloud service providers provide platforms with these technical
capabilities. The industry has become focused on scenario-specific
capabilities related to its own data.

Data security is increasingly related to security of both enterprises
and governments. Cloud service models facilitate of advanced security
technologies to centrally manage data security and provide maximum
security assurance.

Service and business innovations
********************************

Digitalization drives service innovation. It has been driving advances
in smart production, services, and operations, as well as innovations
like the sharing economy and industry chain collaboration, and there is
capability spillover. Technologies are needed for innovations:

-  New technological capabilities such as AI, IoT, blockchain, and
   videos

-  Rapid rollout and iteration are required for first-mover
   opportunities. Cloud service models provide IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS
   capabilities that are always industry leading, lowering barriers to
   entry for service innovation, reducing costs, and accelerating
   innovation.
