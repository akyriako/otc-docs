Cloud Adoption Reasons
==========================

The main reasons for cloud adoption are as follows:

Addressing problems related to software and hardware lifecycles
***************************************************************

When data centers and servers reach the end of their lifecycles, or when
multiple data centers are integrated, instead of using traditional data
centers, this can be a good time to start using advanced cloud service
models. A cloud service model can also help governments and enterprises
eliminate the complex lifecycle management involved with the physical IT
hardware, middleware, and technology platforms used in a traditional
model.

Enhancing service agility
*************************

Cloud services enhance service agility in the following ways:

-  Infrastructure resources are obtained as required for timely launch
   of new services. With physical hardware, you may have to wait weeks
   or even months for new equipment to arrive.

-  Applications and resources can be added on demand to rapidly scale
   services up or out as needed.

-  Technical platform services such as middleware, cloud-native, and
   DevOps can be obtained on demand to accelerate service rollout and
   help customers gain first-mover advantages.

Reducing IT costs
*****************

A cloud service model can adjust the amount of resources deployed based
on service requirements. This flexibility eliminates unnecessary
expenditures. It also lowers the capability requirements for O&M
personnel for the infrastructure and related technical platforms, which
reduces the cost of O&M. In a public cloud model, local data centers do
not need to be managed or maintained, and cloud resources and cloud
service capabilities can be obtained as required, greatly reducing IT
costs. In addition, the trial-and-error costs of trying out a new
service can be significantly reduced.

Enhancing O&M efficiency
***********************

Experienced O&M teams with hundreds or thousands of people from cloud
service vendors provide professional services, significantly enhancing
O&M quality and efficiency.

Improving reliability and security compliance
*********************************************

Cloud service models provide highly reliable, secure technical
capabilities fully compliant with industry regulations, based on a
robust library of best practices. It also provides assistance with
policy formulation, organization process development, and standard
certification.

Supporting global deployment
****************************

The global resources, networks, and platforms deployed on the cloud help
enterprises quickly launch new multinational services and collaborate
with headquarters in terms of services, data, and management.

Building data foundation and data assets
****************************************

The cloud service model helps organisations build data
foundations and data assets by using:

-  Advanced technologies such as big data, AI, data governance, and data
   security.

-  Numerous industry best practices, including data platforms,
   performance optimization, data governance, organization process for
   data operation, and data intelligence application.

-  Continuously introducing new technologies to accelerate innovations.

Cloud service models ensure the industry-leading technologies and best
practices are always available to accelerate service and business
innovation. For example, cloud-native enables more agile services. AI
enables more intelligent decision-making and unmanned or less-manned
production. IoT provides connectivity of everything and intelligent
sensing, and blockchain enables trusted smart contracts.
