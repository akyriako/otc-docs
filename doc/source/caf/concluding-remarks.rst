Concluding Remarks
==================

The CAF white paper is a cloud migration strategy based on best
practices derived from Huawei Cloud customers' cloud migration cases and
based on our own IT migration. It outlines four stages: migration plan,
cloud construction, application setup, and system governance and O&M.
CAF provides full lifecycle guidance for enterprises migrating services
to the cloud, including service plan, preparation, architecture,
organization, management, and O&M. It aims to help enterprises smoothly
migrate services to the cloud and ensure that services can run
efficiently on the cloud. In addition, the risks of migrating to and
using the cloud are reduced, while the value is increased.

If you have any comments or suggestions while reading this white paper,
we sincerely welcome you to send them to our official website. We will
keep working to improve.
