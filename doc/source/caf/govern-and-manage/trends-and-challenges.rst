O&M Trends
^^^^^^^^^^

As cloud computing and AI become more popular, cloud-based O&M evolves
with them. Key trends include:

1. Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations (AIOps). As data volume and
   environment complexity grow rapidly, O&M is increasingly powered by
   AI and big data.
2. Cloud-native, microservice, containerization, and distributed
   technologies mean that labor-intensive O&M no longer meets enterprise
   needs. O&M systems must be automated to better track and locate
   faults.
3. Private cloud, public cloud, and multi-cloud are inevitable choices
   for many enterprises, so they need a cross-cloud O&M assurance
   system.
4. The scope of O&M increases in addition to maintaining systems.
   Enterprises also need overall planning, HA capability, security
   system construction, and R&D and product enablement.

Challenges of Cloud-based O&M
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Cloud-based O&M differs greatly from traditional O&M.

Model
*****

-  Traditional O&M: Enterprises need to build most capabilities on their
   own. They directly manage computing, network, and storage, and other
   resources. They take all the responsibility and full control of their
   resources. However, capability construction is slow and difficult.
-  Cloud-based O&M: Cloud services provide standard basic capabilities.
   Based on these services, enterprises build required architectures and
   O&M capabilities. They use software interfaces or open APIs to manage
   abstract resources. Enterprises share responsibility with cloud
   vendors and do not need full awareness of underlying resources.
   However, capability construction is fast and flexible.

Scope
*****

-  Traditional O&M focuses on maintaining IDC equipment rooms. O&M
   environments are rarely changed and therefore familiar to
   enterprises.
-  Cloud-based O&M varies by IT development and industry requirement.
   Environments include offline IDC, private cloud, public cloud, or
   even multi-cloud. Increasingly complex O&M environments require
   higher O&M control and skills.

Overall capability
******************

-  The cloud provides many more products and functions than traditional
   IDCs. Although O&M personnel are not tasked with underlying
   maintenance, they need to be familiar with the various cloud products
   for better selection and usage.

Security risks
**************

-  Cloud resources are mostly logically isolated, which is riskier than
   physical isolation. Therefore, proper security planning is crucial.
   For example, cloud storage must be encrypted to protect data.
-  The cloud architecture solution is flexible. Most management is based
   on open APIs, and resource access is by running single commands.
   Therefore, security needs to be controlled during external access
   design. In addition, strict audit is recommended for risky commands.

Troubleshooting
***************

-  Cloud service faults are more difficult to locate. Once microservices
   are deployed, the relationship between services becomes more complex.
   Therefore, cloud-based O&M is key to locating faults.
-  Some faults need to be located with the cloud service support team.
   Therefore, in-depth communication with the cloud service support team
   is needed.
