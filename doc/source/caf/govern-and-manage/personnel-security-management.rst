Personnel Security Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section describes how to enhance security through personnel
management.

Recruitment
***********

-  Recruited personnel need a basic understanding about the technologies
   involved and of security management. Arrange a test on this knowledge
   before formal appointment.
-  Check the identities, backgrounds, and qualifications of recruited
   personnel. Archive related materials.
-  Test recruited personnel's technical skills.
-  Introduce the roles and responsibilities to recruited personnel and
   arrange job training.
-  Sign a confidentiality agreement with recruited personnel to forbid
   information leakage.

Staff position change or resignation
************************************

-  When an employee leaves their position, revoke their system
   permissions.
-  When an employee resigns, they need to submit any passwords they have
   been using for company devices. After their resignation, the
   administrator shall change the passwords as soon as possible.
-  Resigning employees shall go follow a strict resignation procedure in
   the HR department and sign a non-disclosure agreement.

Staff appraisal
***************

-  Regularly conduct training focused on improving security skills and
   awareness. Managers, regular employees, and third-party managers and
   users all participate if necessary. Ensure they can identify
   information security threats and risks, and can comply with security
   policies.
-  Conduct strict, comprehensive security audits for personnel in key
   positions. For system administrators, review their identities and how
   they are fulfilling job responsibilities. Review their system
   permissions and job responsibilities, and their compliance with
   non-disclosure regulations. For other key personnel, check their
   identities and evaluate their fulfillment of job responsibilities.
-  Punish those who violate the security policies or regulations. For
   minor violations, a warning and a requirement to write a formal
   apology are appropriate. For major violations, relevant departments
   need to investigate the person's legal responsibilities. If the
   person responsible for a minor violation comes from a third party,
   ask them to correct their mistakes and inform their company.

Security awareness training
***************************

-  Regularly conduct security training. Ask employees to learn about
   network security and ensure they understand relevant policies and
   regulations. Ensure employees understand that they will be held
   responsible even if they meant no harm and even if they violated
   security regulations unintentionally.
-  Accurately define the security responsibilities of every position and
   the punishments for different violations. Arrange meetings to explain
   important or complex regulations if necessary.
-  Arrange publicity activities to help employees learn about network
   security community operations and common violations, for example, by
   making short videos.
-  Develop security training plans. Conduct training on basic
   information security knowledge and job procedures.
-  Record security training in detail and archive the records.
-  Ask employees to sign the Information Security Commitment Letter and
   promise to abide by the company's network security policies and
   regulations.

Security capability training
****************************

-  Establish a network security training system based on the industry
   best practices. Arrange security capability training during different
   stages, for example, during new employee orientation, during their
   regular work week, or before promotions. Ensure employees are capable
   of delivering secure products, solutions and services.
-  Basic network security training: Develop training plans for different
   roles and positions. For example, new employees must pass on-the-job
   training and exams on network security and privacy protection before
   they become regular employees. On-the-job employees need to take
   courses as required by their positions. Managers must participate in
   network security training and seminars.
-  Precise training: Identify typical security problems in the product
   development process and those responsible for the problems. Recommend
   security training programs (including cases, training courses,
   exercises, etc.) to them.
-  Drills: Adopt industry best practices, develop a platform for network
   security drills, and arrange confrontational role playing exercises.
   Improve employees' security capabilities through practices.
-  Incorporate network security requirements in the acceptable criteria
   for jobs and promotion.
