Cloud-based O&M
---------------

As services migrate to the cloud, traditional O&M also shifts to the
cloud. Cloud platforms provide abundant products, massive resources,
elastic scaling, E2E security, open APIs, and diversified billing. These
accelerate service development and reduce costs. How does cloud-based
O&M work, and how can enterprises select and maintain the right
resources?

Cloud-based O&M does not mean simply transferring IDC capabilities to
the cloud. Industry surveys show that fewer than 20% of enterprises
fully utilize their cloud service capabilities. In addition to
maximizing their resources, they must maintain their cloud services,
make their data more secure, and quickly respond to changes and faults
to stay competitive in the digital landscape.
