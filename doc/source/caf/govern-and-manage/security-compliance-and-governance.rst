Security Compliance and Governance
----------------------------------

An increasing number of security and compliance laws and regulations are
being enacted all over the world. Companies that fail to meet these
regulatory requirements may face various penalties and suffer
significant losses.

In accordance with the Cloud Service Cybersecurity & Compliance Standard
(3CS) of Huawei Cloud, the following measures shall be taken:

-  **Develop governance strategies,** including your organization's
   security governance goals, roles and responsibilities, executives'
   commitment, security governance priorities, and core KPIs. Ensure the
   governance system can be efficiently effectively implemented and
   continuously improved.

-  **Incorporate** **security control measures into management
   processes**, so that business departments can better understand and
   implement these measures in their routine work.

-  **Use tools to facilitate security and compliance governance,**
   because some measures involve massive workloads. For example, if the
   responsibilities of a job are changed, all the related account
   permissions must be modified within 24 hours. To defend against
   threats in a timely manner, an organization must develop advanced
   tools, or use the security products or solutions of cloud service
   providers. Huawei Cloud provides 20+ proprietary security services
   and 200+ partner security services for you to choose from.

-  **Set up a governance organization** and assign a director to
   implement governance strategies for network security and privacy
   protection.

-  **Enhance data security.** Focus on eliminating security risks
   throughout the data lifecycle. Avoid just emphasizing data security
   everywhere with no clear focus.

-  **Use metrics to evaluate information security.** Determine the
   dimensions of your security evaluation, collect the required
   information, and develop metrics based on the records and statistics
   generated for the security management activities in your
   organization. The metrics need to be calculable and reflect the key
   points in your organizational security governance.
