Landing Zone Construction
-------------------------

The advantages of the public cloud in terms of security and stability,
service quality, execution efficiency, and cost-effectiveness are
becoming more widely recognized and accepted by enterprises. More and
more enterprises are gradually migrating their application systems to
the cloud and preferentially developing future-oriented, cloud-native
application systems. An era of cloudification is coming. However, in
practice, the following challenges are often encountered:

1. How to isolate the security and faults of service units (such as BGs,
   departments, and project teams) to ensure the isolation of cloud
   resources, applications, and data between service units

2. How to flexibly adjust cloud resources

3. How to design a network architecture across multiple service units
   and establish controlled network connection channels

4. How to plan the production, development, and test environments

5. How to share common resources among multiple service units

6. How to centrally manage and control the budgets and costs of each
   service unit and how to optimize cloud costs

7. How to prevent service units from overusing cloud resources

8. How to divide user groups and how to set permissions for user groups

To address these challenges, Open Telekom Cloud has designed a Landing Zone
solution to effectively manage service units, personnel, permissions,
cloud resources, data, applications, costs, and security. A landing zone
is the area where an aircraft, like a helicopter or an airplane, can
land safely. Cloud vendors have borrowed this term to describe a place
where you can smoothly migrate enterprise service systems on the public
cloud. The Open Telekom Cloud Landing Zone solution helps enterprises build a
secure, compliant, and scalable multi-account environment on the cloud
where multiple accounts can share resources and there is unified
management of the people, finances, resources, permissions, and security
compliance.

-  **People**: Unified management of service units, accounts, users, user
   groups, and roles for multiple accounts

-  **Finances**: Unified management of funds, budgets, costs, invoices, and
   discounts for multiple accounts

-  **Resources**: Unified O&M, monitoring, and management of cloud resources
   including computing, storage, network, data, and applications for
   multiple accounts

-  **Permissions**: Unified management of permissions for cloud resources of
   multiple accounts based on the principle of least privilege (PoLP)

-  **Security compliance**: Unified management of security compliance in
   accordance with the security compliance requirements of countries,
   industries, and enterprises
