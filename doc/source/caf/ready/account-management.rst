Unified Accounting Management for Multiple Accounts
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Accounting management allows multiple Open Telekom Cloud accounts to be
associated with each other for accounting purposes. You can create a
hierarchical organization and a master account, add member accounts to
this organization and associate them with the master account, and use
the master account to perform accounting management of associated member
accounts.

1. **Association between master and member accounts**

A new Open Telekom Cloud account can be directly associated with a master
account or an existing Open Telekom Cloud account can be invited for
association. On Open Telekom Cloud, a master account can create organizations
that match your organizational structure and create new accounts for or
invite existing ones to the organizations.

2. **Funds management**

A master account can allocate its balance and cash coupons to its member
accounts for resource provisioning. A member account can use its own
balance for resource provisioning.

3. **Commercial discount inheritance**

After member accounts are associated with a master account, they can use
the commercial discounts of the master account in their expenditures.

4. **Expenditure query**

A master account and its associated member accounts can log in to Open Telekom
Cloud to view their expenditures. The master account can view the
expenditure data of its member accounts after being approved.

5. **Invoices**

A master account and its associated member accounts can separately
request Open Telekom Cloud to issue invoices for their expenditures. A master
account can request invoices for member accounts.
