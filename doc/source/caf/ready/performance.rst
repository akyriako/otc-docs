Performance
~~~~~~~~~~~

Performance is a key metric for any software system. It is also an
important part of cloud design. In performance design, scalability must
be considered as it is vital to high performance. In addition, solution
selection, performance measurement, performance monitoring, and
performance trade-off must also be considered.

Factors affect the performance of cloud applications
****************************************************

-  Compute latency: the wait time between operations and a direct reflection of cloud computing performance
-  Network throughput: the rate at which data is processed
-  Transmission throughput (bytes/second or bit/second): a key measure of performance
-  Storage input/output operations per second (IOPS): a measure of data transmission
-  Data concurrency: the ability to run multiple programs at the same time

Solution selection
******************

-  Select and combine the solutions that best suit your needs.
-  Upgrade solution selection methods and optimize the selection of resources and configurations through data.

Performance measurement
***********************

-  Configure performance measurement and monitoring metrics.
-  Enable performance tests to be triggered automatically after the fast-running test is complete.
-  Use data visualization to identify performance issues, hot topics, waiting states, or low utilization.

Performance monitoring
**********************

-  Determine the monitoring scope, metrics, and thresholds.
-  Create a full view from multiple dimensions.

Performance tradeoffs
*********************

- Strike a balance in the architecture for better performance, for example by using compression or caching techniques.
