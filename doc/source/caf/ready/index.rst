Phase 2: Ready
=============

To build a highly reliable and available system on the cloud, a
systematic top-level design framework and unified standards are
required. Unified planning at the macro level is required to remove
obstacles to cloud adoption. Based on the industry standards and
practices, here in Open Telekom Cloud we have developed a landing zone system
architecture. This architecture is intended to make it easier for
enterprises to build reliable and systematic capabilities from the
perspectives of the people, finances, resources, permissions, and
security compliance. In addition, Open Telekom Cloud has developed an HA cloud
architecture to ensure high availability of cloud services.
